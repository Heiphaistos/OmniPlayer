## Issues Fixed

### CRASH-1 — SwsContext panic on malformed video
**File:** `crates/omni-core/src/decoder/video.rs:78`
**Risk:** App crash when opening a video with exotic pixel format or 0×0 dimensions.
**Root cause:** `.expect("création SwsContext")` inside `get_or_insert_with` — any failure (corrupt header, unsupported format) caused an unrecoverable panic propagating to the egui thread.
**Fix:** Replaced `.expect()` with proper `?` propagation using `.context(...)`. Error now surfaces as `PlayerState::Error(...)` in the UI instead of crashing.

### CRASH-2 — Stale scaler on mid-stream dimension change
**File:** `crates/omni-core/src/decoder/video.rs:67`
**Risk:** Crash or corrupted frames if video changes resolution/pixel-format mid-stream (common in malformed MKV, HLS adaptive streams, or after seek in variable-resolution content).
**Root cause:** `get_or_insert_with` cached the SwsContext without tracking source dimensions. Old scaler applied to new frame geometry → slice-out-of-bounds or garbage pixels.
**Fix:** Added `scaler_src_w`, `scaler_src_h`, `scaler_src_fmt` fields. Scaler is rebuilt whenever any source property changes.

### HIGH-1 — Unbounded subtitle download (potential DoS / disk exhaustion)
**File:** `pkg/subtitles/client.go:162`
**Risk:** A compromised or malicious OpenSubtitles API response could serve an unbounded payload, exhausting disk or memory.
**Root cause:** `io.Copy(out, fileResp.Body)` with no size limit.
**Fix:** `io.LimitReader(fileResp.Body, maxDownloadSize)` — capped at 10 MB (subtitles are never larger).

### HIGH-2 — Oversized POST body accepted by Go services
**Files:** `pkg/ipc/bridge.go:75`, `cmd/media-indexer/main.go:84`
**Risk:** An attacker on loopback (or via SSRF) could send a multi-GB JSON body, causing OOM.
**Root cause:** `json.NewDecoder(r.Body).Decode(...)` with no body size limit.
**Fix:** `http.MaxBytesReader(w, r.Body, N)` added before decode — 4 KB for subtitle download, 64 KB for directory index.

### HIGH-3 — JSON body built via `fmt.Sprintf` (injection surface)
**File:** `pkg/subtitles/client.go:127`
**Risk:** If `fileID` were ever changed to a string type (e.g., user-supplied), the `fmt.Sprintf` template could be injected. Defense-in-depth concern.
**Fix:** Replaced with `json.Marshal(map[string]int{"file_id": fileID})` — properly escaped, type-safe.

### MEDIUM-1 — Heap allocation in real-time audio callback (I16/U16 paths)
**File:** `crates/omni-audio/src/output.rs:145,163`
**Risk:** On systems with an I16 or U16 audio device format, a fresh `vec![0f32; N]` was allocated on **every CPAL callback** (~100× per second). This causes GC-like latency spikes, audible as periodic audio glitches.
**Fix:** Pre-allocated `scratch: Vec<f32>` moved into the closure. `resize()` is called each callback — amortizes to zero-allocation after the first callback at max buffer size.

### MEDIUM-2 — Audio stream metadata always zero in info panel
**File:** `crates/omni-core/src/probe.rs:113-119`
**Risk:** Info overlay (panel `I`) showed `0 ch / 0 Hz` for all audio streams — useless diagnostics.
**Root cause:** `channels: 0, sample_rate: 0, bit_rate: 0` hardcoded; decoder context was never instantiated for audio streams during probe.
**Fix:** `ffmpeg::codec::context::Context::from_parameters(params).decoder().audio()` called to extract actual `channels`, `rate`, `bit_rate` for each audio stream.

### MEDIUM-3 — D3D11Va hardware acceleration was a no-op
**File:** `crates/omni-core/src/hw_accel/mod.rs:45`
**Risk:** `apply_to_codec()` only set threading for `HwKind::Dxva2`, leaving `D3D11Va` and `Cuda` paths as empty match arms — no acceleration applied despite log claiming otherwise.
**Fix:** Frame-level threading (4 workers) now applied for all three HW kinds. Note: full D3D11VA zero-copy GPU pipeline would require AVHWDeviceContext integration — logged as future work.

### LOW-1 — Hardcoded `"dxva2"` preference in demuxer
**File:** `crates/omni-core/src/pipeline/demuxer.rs:35`
**Risk:** D3D11VA (Windows 8+) is the modern, superior API. Always falling back to DXVA2 loses ~15% throughput on H.265/HEVC content.
**Fix:** `is_d3d11va_available()` probed at pipeline start — uses D3D11VA if available, DXVA2 otherwise. Non-Windows builds pass `None`.

### LOW-2 — Unused Go module dependencies
**File:** `go.mod`
**Risk:** Dependency bloat, supply-chain attack surface for packages that are never loaded.
**Root cause:** `gorilla/mux`, `zerolog`, `cobra`, `diskv` declared but never imported.
**Fix:** `go mod tidy` — `go.mod` now only contains `go 1.22` (all standard-library-only code).

### LOW-3 — Minor code quality
- `cmd/media-indexer/main.go:35`: `".mp4":".mp4"==".mp4"` → `".mp4": true`
- `pkg/ipc/bridge.go:122`, `pkg/metadata/tmdb.go:132`: `interface{}` → `any`
- `pkg/subtitles/client.go:17`: user-agent updated to `OmniPlayer v1.2`

## Architecture Notes (Not Modified — Future Work)

### D3D11VA zero-copy pipeline
True GPU-accelerated decode requires:
1. Creating `AVBufferRef* hw_device_ctx` via `av_hwdevice_ctx_create(AV_HWDEVICE_TYPE_D3D11VA)`
2. Attaching it to the codec context before `avcodec_open2`
3. Handling `AV_PIX_FMT_D3D11` output frames (GPU memory, no CPU copy)
4. Sharing the D3D11 device with wgpu for zero-copy texture upload

This is a non-trivial refactor of `hw_accel/mod.rs` + `video.rs` + `frame_upload.rs`. Tracked as enhancement for v1.3.0.

### Subtitle track switching without pipeline restart
Currently `SelectSubtitleTrack` sends a command that is unhandled in `demuxer.rs` (falls through to `_ => {}`). The selected subtitle track index is never used to switch demuxer routing. Tracked as bug for v1.3.0.
